  ##Simulations

    [p]
      [PhET](https://phet.colorado.edu/) is from the University of Colorado,
      Boulder, and has a variety of interactive simulations. The Charges and
      Fields simulation below is a common tool used in the course. To access all
      of the Physics simulations PhET offers, click [here](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/category/physics).

    [p]
      [My Physics Lab](https://www.myphysicslab.com/) has simulations that mainly
      deal with Physics I concepts. The simulation below is an example that uses
      gravitational force, which can be compared to the electric force equation
      in Physics II. [Here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-physics-1/ap-electric-charge-electric-force-and-voltage/coulombs-law-and-electric-force-ap/a/coulombs-law-and-electric-force-ap-physics-1)
      is an article that compares the two force equations.

    The [Molecular Workbench](http://mw.concord.org/modeler/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxOnJj_L86QIViYbACh1cWgZfEAAYASAAEgI4JfD_BwE)
    is an open source platform with many simulations that span multiple subjects.

  ## Math Resources

    [p]
      [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) provides an
      environment in which programming and mathematics skills combine. It is
      often used in various STEM curricula and may be available for free through
      universities (CU Denver students: click [here](https://www1.ucdenver.edu/offices/office-of-information-technology/software/how-do-i-use/matlab)
      to download).

      MathWorks offers a few free, interactive [tutorials](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html).
      The MATLAB Onramp course is a great introduction to the available tools,
      and enough to get started with physics calculations.

      [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) can be used for calculations
      and provides a breakdown of the mathematics involved. Click [here](https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/science-and-technology/physics/)
      for the WolframAlpha Physics Example page.

      Need to brush up on math topics? Navigate to the [Video Resources](./../post-1)
      page for quick videos on the math knowledge needed for Physics II.

  ## Other Visualization Tools

    [p]
      This [3D Coordinate Visualizer](https://www.glowscript.org/#/user/scomin/folder/VectorCalcDemos/program/Point) is great if you are struggling with three-dimensional coordinates.
      Use it to check your graphs, or play around with it to get an intuition for three-dimensional coordinate systems!
