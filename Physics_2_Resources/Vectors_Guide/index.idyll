In three dimensions, a **vector** is a set of three numbers: <x, y, z>.

This is different than **scalar**, which is a single number that represents a quantity.

**Position** and **Velocity** can both be vector quantities.

## Vector Operations

There are *legal* and *illegal* ways of using vectors. Follow the legal operations to travel farther in this course!

## Legal Operations

With vectors, you **CAN**:

  1. Multiply and divide by a scalar

  2. Take the magnitude

  3. Have a unit vector give direction

  4. Add and subtract other vectors

  5. Differentiate

  6. Take the dot product and cross product

## Illegal Operations

Vectors **CANNOT**:

  1. Be equal to a scalar.

  2. Be added to or subtracted from a scalar.

  3. Be in the denominator of an expression (In this case, take the magnitude, which is a scalar!)

  4. Be added to or subtracted from other vectors with conflicting units.

## Position Vectors

A **position vector** describes a position in 3D space.

Points from the *origin* to the *location*.

Can use the right-hand rule:

  * Thumb = +x

  * Pointer = +y

  * Middle = +z

Each number in the vector (x, y, z) is a **component** of the vector.

  * Components can't be vectors by themselves (as they are only 1 number).

[Equation]
  \vec{0}
[/Equation] is a legal vector.

  * This is the position of an object at the origin or the velocity of an object at rest.

## Unit Vectors

A **unit vector** is a vector that has a magnitude of 1 in some direction.

  * If a unit vector = 1, every component in that vector must be *less* than 1.

There are 3 unit vectors in the Cartesian system that are along the thress axes:

  * i-hat [Equation] \hat{i} = \lt1, 0, 0\gt [/Equation]

  * j-hat [Equation] \hat{j} = \lt0,1,0\gt [/Equation]

  * k-hat [Equation] \hat{k} = \lt0,0,1\gt [/Equation]

  * Example: [Equation] 0.05\hat{i} + (-1.2)\hat{j} + 20\hat{k} [/Equation]

Not all vectors point along the axis. 

How to find a unit vector:

[Equation]
  \hat{r} = \frac{\vec{r}}{|\vec{r}|} = \frac{\lt x,y,z \gt}{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}}
[/Equation]

A vector = another vector if all the components are equal.

A vector may be factored into the product of a unit vector, multiplied by a scalar equal to the magnitude.

  * Example: [Equation] \lt0, 5, 0\gt = 5 \lt0, 1, 0\gt [/Equation]

## Drawing Vectors

For position vectors, the tail is always at the *origin* of a coordinate system.

The x component of a vector is the difference between the x-coordinate of the tail and the x-coordinate of the tip.

Length of arrow = distance from origin.

Direction of arrow = direction of the path from the *initial* position to the *final* position...**displacement**

## Fun Things to do with Vectors

The magnitude of a vector [Equation] \neq [/Equation] the sum of the magnitudes of the two original vectors.

Vector addition is commutative

[Equation]
  \vec{A} + \vec{B} = \vec{B} + \vec{A}
[/Equation]

Vector subtraction is *not* commutative

[Equation]
  \vec{A} - \vec{B} \neq \vec{B} - \vec{A}
[/Equation]

Vector addition and substraction are associative

[Equation]
  (\vec{A} + \vec{B}) - \vec{C} = \vec{A} + (\vec{B} - \vec{C})
[/Equation]

Application of vector subtraction:

[Equation] \Delta \vec{r} [/Equation] = change in quantity = final - intial

[Equation]
  \Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r_{f}} = \vec{r_{i}}
[/Equation]
