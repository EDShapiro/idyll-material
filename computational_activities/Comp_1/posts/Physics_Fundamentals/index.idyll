## Magnitude

##### Question:
The vector [Equation]\vec{a} = \lt 5\times 10^{7}, 3.2 \times 10^{8}, 6.4 \times 10^{7} \gt m/s^{2} [/Equation]. What is [Equation]|\vec{a}|[/Equation]?

##### Approach:
Use [link text:"NumPy" url: "https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.math.html" /], or numpy, to find the magnitude of the vector.
post-1/) - Physics Fundamentals
##### Uses:
Power operator, np.sqrt()

The code below is split into 4 sections to solve the answer. Click the arrows to learn more about the sections of code used to calculate the magnitude.

    #### Import Statements

      This is the main area to import python packageElectric_Fieldss, modules, files, etc. that will be used to run the script and get the correct answer.

      NumPy is a popular package for science computation in python.

      **import** numpy **as** np:

        allows you to use the modules, functions, and objects within the package. In this problem, we need to take the square root, so np.sqrt() can be used.

    #### Given variables

      In this section, organize the variables that are given in a problem.

      The format is generally: variable = numbers

      Note that no units are shown here.
  [/Step]
  [Step]
    #### calculate

      Use the variables listed to solve the problem. Set the problem equal to a unique new variable that you can call later.

      * `new_variable = math`
  [/Step]
  [Step]
    #### Print the answer

    In this section, take the new variable(s) in the calculation section and output the answer by *printing*.

    ```
      print(new_variable)
    ```

    * This will print *only* what the new_variable is equal to, typically a number or set of numbers.
