## Introduction

The purpose of this is to make sure I understand how the html tags work in Idyll.
Once I've accomplished this, I will be able to write the documentation requested in [Issue #621](https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll/issues/621).

### Basics of Syntax

So I believe the translations are:
* Change angle brackets to square ones: `<tag>` becomes `[tag]`
* Change attribute definitions: `style="color:red"` becomes ```style:`{color: 'red'}` ``` (need example which includes a list of style items) // " kill weirdness
* Single-entry tags have the slash moved to the end: `</br>` becomes `[br /]`

### Useful Things

`[p]`, `[div]`, [s]`[float]`[/s] and `[span]` are all useful in HTML and therefore are usefully here too, huzzah!  [br /]
Float is handled by idyll specifically

Maybe also list tags since they do sub-bullets?

[s]Test tables today because Mary was asking about them yesterday or maybe the day before[/s] These are listed as a custom component; not an html issue.

### Things to focus on

Setting class names 
* this is all done through CSS right? Maybe not now I am unsure.
* couldn't figure out a syntax for defining class names in the header
* after the header, you can create a `style` section. It uses plain ol' html syntax.
* classes can be used with `div`, `p`, or `span`
* only one inline style can be used at a time? (ex, can't do color and background-color)

[u]Elements usable with `style`:[/u]
* `background-color` - changes background color of relevant block. Colors can be a 6-digit hex code, rgba, hsl, hsla or a [color name](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp). Seems to only work with css, not inline
* `color` - changes text color
* `margin` - margin outside the box, px = in pixels, affects all sides
* `padding` - margin but *inside* the box
* `font-size` - percentage, px, or [category](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-size.asp).
* `font-weight` - normal/bold or a number (normal=400, bold=700). [More options](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/pr_font_weight.asp)
* `font-style` - normal/italic/oblique (like italic but literally just slanted letters, no change of the characters themselves) - not really working?

Inline styles
* this is the use of `style` as an HTML tag attribute.

## Some Tests

### Inline

[div style:`{color: 'green'}`]
this is green.
[/div]

[div style:`{backgroundColor: 'green'}`]
this is supposed to be on a green background.
[/div]

[div style:`{fontStyle: 'italic'}`]
this is supposed to be italic. but that's not a big deal because of the markup syntax.
[/div]

[div style:`{fontWeight: 'bold'}`]
this is supposed to be bold. but that's not a big deal because of the markup syntax.
[/div]

[div style:`{color: 'red'}`]
this is red, because now I'm questioning whether I just broke everything.
[/div]

[div style:`{fontSize: '3px'}`]
this is supposed to be tiny.
[/div]

[div style:`{padding: '20px'}`]
this has padding.
[/div]

[div style:`{margin: '20px'}`]
this has a margin.
[/div]

here's some normal text for comparison. There is a line break after because the spacing bug comes back up.

[div style:`{color: 'green', padding: '20px'}`]
this is green with padding using one div
[/div]

[div style:`{padding: '20px'}`]
[div style:`{color: 'green'}`]
this is green with padding using multiple divs.
[/div]
[/div]

### Class Use

[div className:"test"]
this one's a div
[/div]

[p className:"test"]
this one's a p
[/p]

[span className:"test"]
this one's a span
[/span]
