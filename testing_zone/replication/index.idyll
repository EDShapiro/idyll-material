## Malfunctioning Links
So if there's text between the first and second paragraph blocks, the links in the third paragraph block function as the links in the first one. 
If I comment that between-paragraph text out or delete it, all of the links work fine. 
If I only have one link in the first paragraph, only one link is broken in the third block.
If I put blank lines before and after this text, there are no issues.
If I put a blank line only before the text but not after, the last link functions as the second one instead of the first one.
