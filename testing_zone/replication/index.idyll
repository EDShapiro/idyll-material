## Malfunctioning Links
So if there's text between the first and second paragraph blocks, the links in the third paragraph block function as the links in the first one. 
If I comment that between-paragraph text out or delete it, all of the links work fine. 
If I only have one link in the first paragraph, only one link is broken in the third block.
If I put blank lines before and after this text, there are no issues.
If I put a blank line only before the text but not after, the last link functions as the second one instead of the first one.

## Tables
[var name:"value" value:"hi" /]
So here's the example, which has two rows and two columns:

[Table value:`[{columnName1: value, columnName2: value}, {columnName1: value, columnName2: value}]` /]


Here's a modified version where I call them rowname instead of columnname:

[Table value:`[{rowName1: value, rowName2: value}, {rowName1: value, rowName2: value}]` /]


Here's a version where I give values instead of calling value:

[Table value:`[{columnName1: 1, columnName2: 2}, {columnName1: 3, columnName2: 4}]` /]


Here's a version where I do both!

[Table value:`[{rowName1: 1, rowName2: 2}, {rowName1: 3, rowName2: 4}]` /]


What if the values are strings?

[Table value:`[{columnName1: "1", columnName2: "2"}, {columnName1: "3", columnName2: "4"}]` /]


I bet this isn't going to work either, using strings and "rowName" (which I'm pretty sure is just the name of the row anyway).

[Table value:`[{rowName1: "1", rowName2: "2"}, {rowName1: "3", rowName2: "4"}]` /]
