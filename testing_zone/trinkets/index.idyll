    ## Project Overview

* We want to use Idyll to make our interactive texts, but it (by itself) isn't capable of embedding everything we want.
* It is possible to embed interactive widgets designed for web use in an idyll page.
* [Trinkets](https://trinket.io) are designed for interactive programs to be written in an existing language and embedded to a web page.
* Therefore, we can use trinkets to embed arbitrary programs in our Idyll pages. (Sounds dangerous.)

    ## Example Trinket

Here is an example of a trinket with the code and the interactive panel side-by-side.

    ## No-Code Trinket

And here's another example with only the interactible:

[iframe src:"https://trinket.io/embed/python/48ba1cf9b8?outputOnly=true" width:"100%" height:"600" frameborder:"0" marginwidth:"0" marginheight:"0"] [/iframe]

Note that setting trinkets to run automatically upon loading the page may have unintended consequences.

    ## Altering the Embed Code

    Unfortunately, the code provided is written for html and will not work without some modification.
    The code provided is:

```
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/48ba1cf9b8" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" 
marginheight="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

    The code we need to use is:

```
[iframe src:"https://trinket.io/embed/python/48ba1cf9b8?outputOnly=true" width:"100%" height:"600" frameborder:"0" marginwidth:"0" 
marginheight:"0"]
[/iframe]
```

*(Line breaks added to help readability)*

There are three differences here:
* All of the <> change to \[\]
* All of the = change to :
* The argument `allowfullscreen` had to be removed entirely

    ## Cat!

This is a pre-generated slide that I kept because it had a kitten.
