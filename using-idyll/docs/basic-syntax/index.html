Open index.idyll to start writing</h2><div class="byline">By: <a href="https://idyll-lang.org">Your Name Here</a></div><div class="idyll-pub-date">Wed Jun 03 2020</div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Idyll is based primarily on markdown and also contains most html features, which in turn allows the implementation of css and javascript.</p><p>For basic markup, see the Idyll docs page on <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/docs/syntax">markup syntax</a>.
Creating a new page will also give you several examples that you can follow and adapt.
The purpose of this page is to outline key differences between Idyll and markdown/html as well as some notes about javascript use when embedding components.</p><h2 id="differences-from-html">Differences from HTML</h2><p>The main difference between Idyll and HTML is that Idyll uses <code>[]</code> instead of <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.
For things that do not have an open/close, such as <code>&lt;/br&gt;</code>, move the / to the end <br/> (<code>[br /]</code>).</p><h2 id="differences-from-markdown">Differences from Markdown</h2><p>Generally speaking, there are no major differences from markdown. 
However, there are some commands that (at time of writing) were either missing a functionality available in markdown or have a different (undetermined) syntax, such as sub-bullets.</p><h2 id="components-and-javascript">Components and JavaScript</h2><p>When embedding a component, you will often be using javascript-like syntax.
While you will still use <code>[]</code> surround everything, variables will go in `<code>backticks</code>`
, unlike the ”<code>quotes</code>″ used for most variables in html-like syntax.</p><p>Here is an example from the Idyll documentation:</p><pre><code>[Component propName:`2 * 2 * 2 * 2`/]</code></pre></div></div></div></div>
